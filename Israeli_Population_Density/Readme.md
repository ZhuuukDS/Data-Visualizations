## Population Density of Israel

As someone who is passionate about data, I was motivated by Spencer Schien to create a map highlighting the population density of Israel. 
Using the `Kontur Inc.` population data, `R language`, and the `rayshader` library, I was able to produce this stunning visualization that brings the data to life.
