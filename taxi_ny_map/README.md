# Taxi Locations on Map

In this project, I created stunning visualizations of taxi pick-ups and drop-offs in New York City using Holoviews, Plotly, Folium, and Datashader. These tools allowed me to highlight the differences in taxi trip intensity depending on the day of the week and hour.

The main goal of the visualization part of this project was to create informative and visually appealing visualizations that can help to communicate the patterns I identified to others. 

Overall, the visualization tools used in this project were powerful and flexible, allowing me to create beautiful and informative visualizations of the taxi pick-ups and drop-offs in New York City.
